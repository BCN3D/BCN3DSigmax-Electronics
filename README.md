About the electronics of the Sigmax, the main difference is in the power electronics. Instead of using a different power supply or designing a new heated bed PCB, it was decided to just duplicate the components. That allowed us to reduce the development times and costs.

As a result, it was needed to redefine the power line. Thereâ€™s a power supply for the control electronics and the hotends and connects to a relay, which closes the circuit to feed the heated beds with a second power supply. 
The rest of the components and circuits remain unchanged.
